# Processed expression values download file documentation

This documentation provides information about the annotation and experiment files (e.g. annotations to anatomy and development, quality scores used in QCs, chip or library information), and processed expression values (e.g., read counts, TPM and FPKM values, log values of Affymetrix probeset normalized signal intensities). The files can be found on the Bgee [download page](/download/processed-expression-values) for each species. To access the download page from the Bgee homepage, go to the download section on the top toolbar and click on "Processed expression values". This will bring you to the download page where you can either search for a specific species in the top search bar or look through the species list at the bottom and click on any species logo to see the different download file options available for each data type. These datasets can also be downloaded directly using our R package "BgeeDB".

## Download files

There are four data types that are available for download: bulk RNA-Seq, single cell RNA-Seq (full-length and droplet-based), and Affymetrix. You can read more about them by following the following links pointing to their corresponding documentation page.
