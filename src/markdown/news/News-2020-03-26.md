**Release of Bgee version 14.1**

This is an incremental update of Bgee, with an updated RNA-Seq
dataset, using the same genomes and ontologies as for the previous
version Bgee 14.0. New RNA-Seq libraries have been added; some
libraries previously integrated in Bgee have been discarded
following corrections and improvements of quality controls. The
Affymetrix, *in situ* hybridization, and EST datasets, are the
same as for the previous release of Bgee 14.0. All calls of
presence/absence of expression, expression scores, and all the Bgee
tools and download files, have been updated accordingly.

For most species in Bgee, notably non-human primates and farm and
domestic animals, this represents a major improvement of the anatomy
and life stage coverage of the data, making all Bgee tools much more
useful, notably [TopAnat](https://archives.bgee.org/14-1/?page=top_anat#/)
and the [gene pages](https://archives.bgee.org/14-1/?page=gene).
