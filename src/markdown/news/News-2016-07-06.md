Release of Bgee version 13.2:
* Major update of our gene page and ranking algorithm:
    * We are happy to announce that we have updated our ranking
      algorithm allowing to discover the most relevant anatomical
      entities and life stages where a gene is expressed. We hope
      that you will appreciate the noticeable improvements.

    * The gene page has been updated to display the rank scores of
      conditions where a gene is expressed, allowing to easily
      identify major functional shifts in gene expression.

* Give a try to this updated ranking by searching for your favorite
  gene, or by using the example links, on the
  [gene search page](https://bgee.org/bgee15_0/?page=gene}).
* We now display more information about the sources of data used in
  Bgee, see the new [data source page](https://bgee.org/bgee15_0/?page=source), and new information added to the gene pages.
