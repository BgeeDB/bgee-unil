# Bgee becomes a GCBR and Elixir Interoperability service

We are happy to announce that Bgee has been selected as a [Global Core Biodata Resource](https://globalbiodata.org/what-we-do/global-core-biodata-resources/) by the [Global Biodata Coalition](https://globalbiodata.org/). It means that the GBC panel of independent experts considers Bgee as a resource of fundamental importance to the life science community. We are very pleased that our contribution is recognized in data curation and standardization, ontology development, and in creating new knowledge from gene expression data. Bgee joins the list of [52 GCBRs](https://globalbiodata.org/what-we-do/global-core-biodata-resources/list-of-current-global-core-biodata-resources/) as of today.

Moreover, Bgee has been recognized as a [Recommended Interoperability Resource](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/interoperability/rirs) by [Elixir](https://elixir-europe.org/). The Elixir panel of external experts identifies Bgee as a resource contributing to FAIR data access in life science.

This is of course great news for us, but more importantly should allow us in the future to better support our activities, in order to continue providing effective access to reusable gene expression data, and develop new tools to support your research activities.
