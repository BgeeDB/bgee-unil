**Release of Bgee version 15.2**

In this release, we have added hundreds of curated, standardized, and processed single-cell 10X Genomics libraries.
You can retrieve them from our [raw data interface](/search/raw-data?pageType=raw_data_annots&data_type=SC_RNA_SEQ).

We have also added about 14,000 bulk RNA-Seq libraries to allow for more meaningful gene expression comparisons across species. We targeted specific organs and species for which comparisons were not yet possible.

Of note, these new data are not yet fully integrated in our tools such as the gene expression pages and TopAnat. Thanks to this partial update, we are now able to respond quickly to the need for curation and standardization of new datasets. The full integration of these data in our tools and gene expression pages will be included in the following release.

This release includes the addition of a large number of bulk RNA-Seq libraries in *Salmo salar* (Atlantic salmon). We also now provide "physiological status", which holds information about the smoltification status of individuals, which is especially relevant for *Salmo salar*. These new data have been fully integrated in all our tools and gene expression pages, as opposed to the new data added in other species (see point above).

We also provide new information for annotated samples in this release: you can now retrieve free text information provided by the authors, along with the standardized ontology terms to capture information about anatomy, cell type, developmental and life stage. This is especially useful for single-cell RNA-Seq data, where the ontologies are not always able to capture the diversity of cell types identified in such experiments.
