**Release of Bgee version 15 beta**

This is a major update of Bgee, with 28 new species; integration of
single-cell RNA-Seq full-length data; improved treatment of bulk
RNA-Seq, and addition of new libraries; and improved statistical
treatment to control for False Discovery Rate. All *in situ*
hybridization data retrieved from Model Organism Databases, and all
genomes and underlying ontologies, have been updated.
    
It is for now released as a beta version.
**Please note that the data for this beta release will not be archived and should not be used in publications, expecting long-term retrieval**
. The SPARQL endpoint was not updated.

* We are happy to announce that
**Bgee now includes single-cell RNA-Seq full-length data**
. We have designed statistical methods allowing to produce
reliable present expression calls and expression scores for this
data type. We also use annotation procedures allowing to capture
with a high precision the cell types studied and their anatomical
origin (post-composition of ontology terms). It is
straightforwardly integrated in all our tools, along with all
other data (bulk RNA-Seq, Affymetrix, <i>in situ</i>
hybridization, Expressed Sequence Tags). For this release, we have
integrated 1 481 libraries in human and mouse.

* 28 species have been added, while 5 species have been
discontinued, due to new criteria on anatomical coverage.
**In total, Bgee now integrates expression data in 52 species.**
* We have improved the control of False Discovery Rate to produce
present/absent expression calls. Rather than integrating boolean
calls (where present calls always dominate), we produce a p-value
for each expression call from each sample, and integrate these to
produce a single call for each gene in each condition,
**using a Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control for FDR**.
* **We have improved the treatment of bulk RNA-Seq data to generate more reliable absent expression calls**. 
We now annotate precisely the protocol used to generate
libraries (e.g., polyA, ribo-minus), and the gene types targeted
(e.g., protein coding, miRNA). With this information, we produce
absent expression calls for a gene only if its type was accessible
to the RNA-Seq protocol used.
* **5 818 bulk RNA-Seq libraries have been added**, and 47 libraries removed following improved quality controls.
    * For model organisms:
        * 261 added, 12 removed, for *Homo sapiens* (total library count: 5 984)
