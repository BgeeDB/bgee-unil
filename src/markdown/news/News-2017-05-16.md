**Release of Bgee version 14-beta**

* 12 new species, bringing the total to 29:
    * new mammal species: horse, rabbit, dog, cat, guinea pig, hedgehog;
    * new Drosophila species: D. ananassae, D. mojavensis, D.
      pseudoobscura, D. simulans, D. virilis, D. yakuba.
* All species now have RNA-Seq data.
* Addition of curated human RNA-Seq data from GTEx, removing
  unhealthy samples; see [human data](https://archives.bgee.org/14-0/?page=download&action=expr_calls#id1).
* Improved quality annotation of calls: replacement of &quot;low
  quality&quot; / &quot;high quality&quot; by:
    * &quot;Gold&quot;: &#8805;2 experiments with a high confidence call;
    * &quot;Silver&quot;: 1 experiment with a high confidence call,
      or &#8805;2 experiments with low confidence calls;
    * &quot;Bronze&quot;: 1 experiment with a low confidence call;
    these are not shown by default.

* Update of download pages to make it easier to choose files to
  retrieve; inclusion of gene ranks (as used in gene pages) in call
  files.
