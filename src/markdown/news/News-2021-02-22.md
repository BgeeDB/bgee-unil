Release of Bgee version 14.2

This is an incremental update of Bgee, improving data coverage
mostly for animals of agronomic and veterinary relevance, and adding
new functionalities to the website

* On all gene pages you will now find links to ortholog and paralog
    gene pages, and links to directly run an [expression comparison analysis](https://bgee.org/bgee15_0/?page=expression_comparison) on them.
* We have made [TopAnat](https://bgee.org/bgee15_0/?page=top_anat#/) faster when used with no decorrelation method.

We have added new RNA-Seq libraries to Bgee. For animals of agronomic and veterinary relevance:
* *Bos taurus*: 1299 RNA-Seq libraries added
* *Sus scrofa*: 286 RNA-Seq libraries added
* *Cavia porcellus*: 255 RNA-Seq libraries added
* *Oryctolagus cuniculus*: 49 RNA-Seq libraries added
* *Canis lupus familiaris*: 20 RNA-Seq libraries added
* *Equus caballus*: 13 RNA-Seq libraries added
* *Felis catus*: 2 RNA-Seq libraries added


For other species in Bgee: 

* *Homo sapiens*: 47 RNA-Seq libraries added
* *Mus musculus*: 176 RNA-Seq libraries added
* *Macaca mulatta*: 22 RNA-Seq libraries added
* *Rattus norvegicus*: 10 RNA-Seq libraries added
* *Monodelphis domestica*: 7 RNA-Seq libraries added
* *Gorilla gorilla*: 2 RNA-Seq libraries added

All calls of presence/absence of expression, expression scores, and
all the Bgee tools and download files, have been updated
accordingly.

Other changes in this release: 
* We have made changes to the way we propagate expression calls
  along the graph of conditions: calls of absence of expression are
  no longer propagated to child anatomical entities, so that an
  information of absence of expression is more reliable from now on.
* We have also corrected some relations between anatomical entities
  that were incorrectly missing in our database, improving the
  propagation of expression calls as well.
