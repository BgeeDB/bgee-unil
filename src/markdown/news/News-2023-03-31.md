**We are recruiting a postdoc** to work on the bioinformatics / biostatistics of new types of gene expression data in Bgee: new single-cell, isoform-specific RNA-seq, etc.
We integrate all data types into summary scores and calls of expression, so there are a lot of challenges in integrating each new data type.
And a lot of opportunities both for methodological research, and for downstream biology using these newly integrated data.
