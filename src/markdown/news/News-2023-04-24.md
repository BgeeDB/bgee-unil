New interface which provides access to all of our detailed annotations and calls of expression:
* The [Raw data annotations page](/search/raw-data) allows to browse and select the annotations of bulk RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, microarrays, ESTs and in situ hybridization. For each experiment we provide detailed annotations and corresponding processed expression values (e.g., TPM, read count, p-value of expression call). All experiments are linked to source databases.
* The [Expression calls page](/search/expression-calls) allows to browse and export the raw data behind each presence or absence of expression call in Bgee, per species, gene, and condition.
* Both Raw data and Expression calls can be filtered by species, anatomy, cell type, development and life stage, sex and strain.

We have also added the following pages:
* [The Scientific advisory board (SAB) of Bgee](/about/bgeesab).
* [Links to videos of courses or tutorials on Bgee](/about/videos).

Bgee is on [Mastodon](https://genomic.social/@bgeedb)
