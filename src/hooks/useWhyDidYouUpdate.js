 * This hook makes it easy to see which prop changes are causing a component to

 * renders the same results given the same props you can use the React.memo
 * higher order component, as we've done with the Counter component in the
 * below example. In this case if you're still seeing re-renders that seem
 * unnecessary you can drop in the useWhyDidYouUpdate hook and check your
 * console to see which props changed between renders and view their
 * previous/current values. Pretty nifty huh?
