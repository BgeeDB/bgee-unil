A user story in Agile software development is a mean used to get a description of a particular feature from an end-user
perspective. It describes the type of user, as well as what the user wants and why. These stories help to create a
nominal description of a requirement.

Agile user stories can be written at different levels of detail and that makes them beneficial. Usually, they define the
following:
````
- A type of user
- User's intention
- The value they get (from a particular feature)
````

You may structure user stories in the following ways:

````
- An epic that includes more user stories (they should later be decomposed into smaller user stories)
- A story itself
- Substories with more details
````

An elementary Agile user story template typically looks like this:

````
As a <role>, I want <feature> so that <reason>
````

> Users should be able to _____.
> 
>As a user, I want to do ___ because ____.
> 
> Given that I'm doing ___, I should be able to ___ in order to ___.


A simple example:

````
As a regular user, I want to upload a video file so that I can share my video content with my colleagues.
````

The essential rule of writing a user story means that it should be short and desirably fit on a sticky note or a card.

> An Epic is a high-level body of work that bands together with a group of related Stories.
# Creating effective user stories

### 1. Validating user needs

At first, you need to define the users who will use your product/service and create buyer personas. A buyer persona is a
semi-fictional character of your ideal user.

You should analyze what problems your buyer personas are facing and define the ways your product will help them to solve
their challenges. At this stage, you may conduct interviews with target users, understand their pain points, ask
appropriate questions, etc.


### 2. Creating epics
Writing epics will help you sketch your product key functionality without going deep in details.

Here is an example:
````
You are creating a dating app for users who can to create, manage and edit their profiles. So, the epic is: Managing user
profile.
````

User stories are:
````
As a user, I want to write my bio info so I can keep it up to date.
As a user, I want to add dating preferences so my contacts will define me easier.
As a user, I want to add the cover picture to my page so my profile will look bright and attractive.
````
Epics assist to track large ideas in a product backlog without the need to overpopulate it with multiple items. You may
use Burndown charts to visualize epics as they keep all stakeholders informed and make the development team motivated.

### 3. Creating user stories according to the user types

Your next step is diving into the details to break the epics down into the stories.

### 4. Defining acceptance criteria for stories

Acceptance criteria outline the boundaries of user stories. They are used to confirm when a story is completed and
working as intended.

These criteria can be functional (identifying user tasks, functions or business processes), non-functional
(design and UI-related) and performance criteria (related to performance metrics, for example, loading time).

# INVEST

Great User Stories always fit the INVEST set of criteria by Bill Wake:

- [ ] Independent - they can be developed in any sequence and changes to one User Story don't affect the others.
- [ ] Negotiable - it's up for the team to decide how to implement them; there is no rigidly fixed workflow.
- [ ] Valuable - each User Story delivers a detached unit of value to end users.
- [ ] Estimable - it's quite easy to guess how much time the development of a User Story will take.
- [ ] Small - it should go through the whole cycle (designing, coding, testing) during one sprint.
- [ ] Testable - there should be clear acceptance criteria to check whether a User Story is implemented appropriately.
