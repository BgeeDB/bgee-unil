The svg/ folder comes from the release tarball available from https://github.com/ionic-team/ionicons (in the src/ folder).

The js files come from https://unpkg.com/ionicons@X.Y.Z/dist/ionicons/###.js
They have to be downloaded manually (until better)
    with X.Y.Z the version number
    with ###.js the js file
